If you happen to use cedit, the internal file editor of Midnight Commander,
then you may want to use the syntax highlighting for CHRiSM.
Install it by copying the file "prolog.syntax" to ~/.mc/cedit/,
and then adding the following two lines to the file ~/.mc/cedit/Syntax :

-------------------------------------------------------------          
file ..\*\\.(pl|chr|psm|chrism)$ Prolog\sprogram
include prolog.syntax
-------------------------------------------------------------          


The syntax highlighting is not perfect but it is better than nothing.
Also you may want to adjust the colors of your terminal, because I'm
using a quite nonstandard color scheme and if you're using the default,
things are gonna look ugly.
