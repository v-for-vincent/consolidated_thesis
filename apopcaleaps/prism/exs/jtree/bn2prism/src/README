**** README (bn2prism: src) ****

This directory contains Java codes of a translator from BNs to junction-tree
Prism programs.  For the details of each Java classes, please consult
$(TOP)/doc/html/index.html, where $(TOP) is the top directory for BN2Prism.
This directory should be $(TOP)/src just after the package unfolded.

[Files]
  LICENSE           ... license statements on BN2Prism (modified BSD)
  Makefile          ... makefile for running javac and javadoc
  BN2Prism.java     ... main class
  BayesNet.java     ... class for a BN
  Cluster.java      ... class for a cluster in a junction tree
  Variable.java     ... class for a random variable in a BN
  MyException.java  ... original class for exceptions
  MyHandler.java    ... original class for handling XML input errors

[Requirements]
  - JDK 1.5 or later is required for building and running the translator.
  - PRISM 1.9 or later is required for running the translated PRISM
    programs.

[How to build]
  Please type the following commands:

    make            ... compile Java source
    make doc        ... create javadoc documents
    make clean      ... clean up class files
    make cleandoc   ... clean up Javadoc documents

  By default, the class files will be placed under $(TOP)/lib, and the
  javadoc documents will be placed under $(TOP)/doc/html.  To change
  the settings, please modify Makefile by some text editor.
  
[How to run]
  See the documents below $(TOP)/doc or $(TOP)/exs/README

[Remaining tasks]
  - Refactoring (currently BayeNet.java is too big)
